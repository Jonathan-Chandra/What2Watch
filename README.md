# What2Watch

#### Description
What2Watch is a web application that keeps track of a user's 
entertainment media subscriptions (currently US only) and creates a master

features such as movies/shows that are also leaving streaming subscriptions 
such as Netflix, as well as give suggestions of shows to watch based off of 
the user's available time.
